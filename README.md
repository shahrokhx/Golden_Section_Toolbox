#### Details:
> This toolbox is part of the optimization visualizing series that I developed during the optimization class at Georgia Tech. More details about these toolboxes and packages is presented in <a href="http://www.sshahi.com/projects/tlbx-2-opt/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.

Have you ever heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank"> golden ratio </a> and it's applications (in fact, appearance) in the nature, physical processes, architecture, art, etc.? The <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search" target="_blank"> golden-section search algorithm </a> is another application of this mysterious number. This toolbox is an implementation of this optimization approach and provide an step-by-step visualization of the optimization process. This toolbox can also serve as an effective educational demo in the optimization courses.
